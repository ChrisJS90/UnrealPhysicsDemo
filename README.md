# Physics_Project

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

In this tutorial I learned how to apply physics materials to objects and change the physics properties to simulate different surfaces. Additionally I learned how to utilise physics constraints to have move objects move in a restricted manner (i.e. only swing on one axis like a hinge).
